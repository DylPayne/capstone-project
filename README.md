# Capstone Project IV

We have been tasked with creating a web page which has a topic of our choice. We had to display our knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript by using things like local and session storage, contact-me forms, a comments page and a save for later page.

## Installing:

To use this project, download all the files in this repository and put them all in the same folder. Then all you need to do is open one of the HTML files in your favourite web browser.


## Website features:

### Save for later:  
To use this feature, simply click on a testimonial or a photo. You will then be asked to confirm whether or not you want to save the project. If you click 'ok', an alert will be displayed which shows how many items you have saved.  

### Like a photo:  
To use this feature all you need to do is click the thumbs up, and the background of the cell will turn green.  

### Add a comment:
To add a comment simply navigate to the comments page and click add comment. A form will appear which allows you to fill in your data.
